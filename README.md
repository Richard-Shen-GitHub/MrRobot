# Mr. Robot and cybersecurity

# Project Proposal

**Project Goal:**

3 distinct goals:

1) Analysing the drama thriller television* *series 'Mr. Robot'*

2) Teaching the theory of how the cybersecurity attacks work and creating an interactive community on the platform*

3) Discovering potential tools and methods to defend against those attacks.*

**Project Description (more depth):**

1) Analysing how realistic the cybersecurity related scenes and events are. What would actually happen in real life if the exact events were replicated. Providing a more technical perspective on what would happen.*

2) Creating a website that will breakdown the series per episode and provide a user friendly and aesthetic UX / UI so that people without cybersecurity knowledge can learn and understand on a high level how it works.*

3) Going beyond the novice knowledge and providing solutions from the victim's perspective on what procedures, tools and methods can be performed to be either preventative or reactive, and will defend against the cybersecurity attack.*

**Project Schedule**

**Week 1**

- Begin developing the website for teaching the content

**Week 2**

- *Watch S1E1 and begin analysing the episode scene by scene to find any cybersecurity related content*
- Further developing the website to have placeholders and be able to navigate and access the screen where the teaching for S1E1 will exist (hardcoded for now)
- Research into common and effective defensive mechanisms used in the cybersecurity industry to start learning it myself

***Note:*** *Project Proposal Due Wednesday 9 am [With Week 1 Logbook]*

**Week 3**

- *Watch S1E2 and repeat*
- Reach a point on the website where all placeholders will be dynamically accessed and created by an administrator of the website (me)
- Referring back to S1E1 and figuring out if the defensive mechanisms which I researched can be applied
- Continue research into common and effective defensive mechanisms used in the cybersecurity industry to start learning it myself

**Week 4**

- *Watch S1E3 and repeat*
- Improve the website UX / UI by improving the navigation, allowing the administrator to put photos and window views of videos which are relevant
- Creating a database for the website, testing that it works; allow comments to be created on each week’s content so that it develops a self-learning and engaging community
- Referring back to S1E2 and figuring out if the defensive mechanisms which I researched can be applied
- Continue research into common and effective defensive mechanisms used in the cybersecurity industry to start learning it myself

**Week 5**

- *Watch S1E4 and repeat*
- Find ways to incorporate some of the defensive mechanisms researched into my own website, and testing it on [localhost](http://localhost) to see if it will work before deploying publicly
- Referring back to S1E3 and figuring out if the defensive mechanisms which I researched can be applied

***Note:*** *Mid-Term Progress* Video Due Wednesday 9 am [Week 4 Activity]

**Week 6**

- *- Flexibility Week --*
- Relax a bit and just watch S1E5 and more just to get a high-level understanding of what is happening and start brainstorming ideas

**Week 7**

- *Watch S1E5/6 and repeat*
- Find a way to deploy the website onto a publicly hosted server 24/7, and then using my PC to try to ‘hack’ my own website and see if the defensive mechanisms which I deployed are working
- Referring back to S1E4 and figuring out if the defensive mechanisms which I researched can be applied

‌

**Week 8**

- Figure out if more episodes need to be watched in order to provide a more detailed delivery and analysis of ‘Mr. Robot’
- Get other friends in my tutorial class to go to the website and provide feedback - also try to hack it if they can
- Referring back to S1E5/6 or more and figuring out if the defensive mechanisms which I researched can be applied

***Note:** Final Report Deliverable Due Friday*

**Project Deliverables/Outcomes:**

- A complete and functioning website which is hosted on a public server - running 24/7 and accessible to anyone with internet. There will be proper navigation and interaction with the different screens in order to access each week’s content
- A detailed analysis of ‘Mr. Robot’ and it’s cybersecurity related content / scenes and events, to the point that a person with cybersecurity knowledge would be able to read the analysis and have a good understanding of what is happening during the scene
- Providing a learning environment and community for fans of ‘Mr. Robot’ and / or cybersecurity to come together on a single platform to provide their opinions on the cybersecurity content in the series and also analyse, teach and discover defense mechanisms
